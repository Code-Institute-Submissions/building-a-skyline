# BUILDING A SKYLINE

Cities: Skylines - game or  a tool? Page intending to help beginners and intrigue professionals.

![Desktop Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vlad-404/building-a-skyline/master/assets/images/mockup.JPG "Desktop Demo")

Idea behind this project was to make a page about game called Cities: Skylines. It is a city building simulation game. 
I already have a lot of experience with this game and a really helpfull community that is ready to help me out, so I decided to make one stop page for relevant links and resources for this game.
In this short project, I will start with introduction to the game with links to purchase and finish with mutual influence of real life and the game.

Most of the text and pictures will be my own, and I will reference some videos that are publicly available. I have contacted some of the friends in the community, and they allowed me to use their work as a part of my project. You can find them in *"Credits"* section.


 Since there is a huge gap between a person who is just starting a game and a professional, the site consists of one single scrollable page divided into 5 separate sections, one of them being a navbar that will be visible at all time to ease the navigation. 

This website tries to address the needs of:
* a beginner who wishes to start the game and find relevant tutorials
* regular player who wants to know about mods, map making, introduction to traffic and to expand the limits of the game
* advanced player who wants to know how to make his city look more realistic
* a professional, like a city planner who can find examples of how game was used to simplify and speed up simulations and visualisations

## UX

My targeted audience will be gamers, enthusiasts and even professionals like city planners and Architects. All of these people are connected with one mutual subject: city planing.

This project is the best way to help people learn and achieve progress in this game because:

* basic tutorials, minimum requirements for pc and platforms available are all in one place (with links)
* purchasing options are easy accessible
* there is no single page they can go to. They can search through Google, but having all or most things in one place is very handy
* you can easily develop your skills as page is divided in three sections. You can find your level and see where you can go next
* essential mods are at a glance which is the most asked question in any group
* lots of people are asking how to make their cities more realistic. There's a complete section on that
* there are examples of mutual influence of real world and this game
* professionals have an example of city of Stockholm which used Skylines as a platform for development of one of their parts of the city

My expectation after visiting this page will be that the beginners will want to discover more about the game, and professionals will be intrigued by application of this game as a tool to help them in their simulations in real life situations. Both of these will have enough material to go on with the resources found on this page.

All the preparations for this page were used from different sources: 

* I made a [Facebook group poll](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a7LyO0rlAAxObDncjQ4M_wxV4IBSx3Jj/view?usp=sharing) to see what people are most interested in. Unfortunatelly, group is private and I can only leave a screenshot of it.
* browsed different pages like Facebook, Reddit, Discord groups to see targeted audience biggest interests
* browsing competition games didn't prove to be usefull, as direct competition, EA's latest [SimCity](https://www.ea.com/games/simcity) failed and wasn't considered as a true competition
* browsed official [Cities: Skylines](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/cities-skylines-all/) page and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV9RoEcgAO1Uc7oxZGS8Lkw) for most appropriate info which is supported by game developer
* I used classic "_pen and paper_" method to give the page it's rough outline. Click [here](https://github.com/Vlad-404/building-a-skyline/tree/master/wireframes) for images
* after initial sketches, I was browsing through [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) to find easiest methods of building the page

## User stories:

1. As a new visitor to the page, I want to be able to navigate it with ease and find what I want easily
2. As a new player to Cities: Skylines, I want to know if my computer can play this game

10. as a returning visitor to this page, I want to be able to learn more about the game and it's mechanics


## Features

Simplicity was the basic idea behind this project and that was proven to be difficult, as this game has a lot of content and a large community. For this reason, I divided the page into 5 sections:
 * Welcome page - this will be the first thing a visitor seas
 * Beginners section
 * Advanced section
 * Pro section and
 * Navbar - for easier navigation

 I decided to go with one scrollable page because I wanted to tease the visitor to peek into next section, and continue discovering the page.This way, they will easily find their skill level and be able to find what they need.

 Colours used on this page corespond with in-game colours for residential, commercial and industrial zones, which all of the players are familiar with.

Fonts selected for this page are:

1. [Kanit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kanit) - for h1 and h2 titles
2. [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) - for smaller titles and bolds
3. [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) - for paragraphs and general
4. Sans serif - as a default font if above fonts fail to load

I've used them because of all the fonts I looked, these looked like a technical letter the most, which is associated with architecture and urbanism. Games logo font, Pricedown, was a payed font for web embedding, so I was looking for something that doesn't require monetisation.
  
### Existing Features

Each section is dedicated to users with different level of knowledge while the pro section might be usefull to even professionals such as city planners. Accordingly to these sections, each interest group has links that they can benefit from:

**Intro section** is designed as simple as possible: pick your level of knowledge and follow the links. There are videos in each card which represent what each section is about. It engages the user and gives them basic navigation.

**Beginners** section was created for users who want to buy the game and ones who just did that, but don't know where to go next. In this part, they will be able to see if they can play the game on their console or is their computer strong enough to run the game. Also, there are links to very basics, like terminology in the game and some video tutorials.

**Advanced** section is for the people who have some experience with the game and want to know how to make their ideas into reality. Therefore, there are links to basic map making, and traffic, links to workshop so users can expand the abilities of the game with most used mods which is most often asked question in any group and/or forum.

**Pro/Realism** section is for people who know how to handle all of the game's tools including mods, but want to make their cities look more realistic. This will enable users to have more detailed cities with better looking visuals, and a comprehensive guide to map making. This is also where I added links to content creators for the game, added videos and playlists which will relate this game to the real world and it's application. Maybe even intrigues some visitors to start making mods and assets for the game.

**Navbar** - reason why navbar is a the bottom instead of on top is that the toolbar in game is at the bottom of the UI in game. As it has the same colour, old players will be used to it and new ones will get introduced to it.

### Features Left to Implement

People expressed most interest in traffic in this game, as you can see from the poll(see UX section). However, due to lack of time, I decided to leave this for future releases as it has a lot of ground to cover and cannot be explained in just a couple of links.

Navbar that I used for my page is a bootstrap pre-made one and had a search bar integrated in it. My page would highly benefit from it, but since it requires coding that I haven't learned yet, I decided to leave it for future relases.

After this project is submitted, there are plans to re-use it to make a portal after I gain enough knowledge in web programming(and have time) to do it. Basically, this project will be a base on which I will continue adding content, untill all or most of the content is my own. Based on this, navigation tree was also planned, but since it has only one page for now, this was left for future releases.

## Technologies Used

Tools used building this page consist of:

**HTML** - Used for creating the content and building the basic framework for the page

**CSS** - used for formating, beautifying the page and also for some effects

**JavaScript** - used within bootstrap to create colapsable navbar for smaller screens

**[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** - used this library to simplify, speed up and optimise the page creation and looks of the page

**[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)** - used for website font style

**[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)** and **[Icon Finder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)** - for custom icons

**[FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/)** and user freepik for the usage of free favicon

**[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)** - knowledge base on how to make certain element

**[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)** - to figure out why something isn't working

**[Github](https://github.com/)** and **[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)** - to build and host the page

**[Repl.it](https://repl.it/)** - to re-use the code I practiced with

**[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)** - to backup the page locally


## Testing

Testing was conducted using different web browsers and platforms:

* Google Chrome (v. 80.0.3987.106), Opera (v. 66.0.3515.72) and Firefox (v.73.0) had no issues displaying the page. All links, animations and custom effects were working as they are intended
* tested the page with different android devices, and noticed that on some, navbar was too big, so I reduced the amount of text describing the link to one word with icon
* I have sent my page to couple of friends to test the page on more devices. This returned in some usefull feedback:
   - making the advanced section blue colour a bit lighter as it was difficult to read for some people
   - section titles were getting underneath the cards on very small screen sizes; still looking into fixing this
* used inspection mode to go through different screen sizes to see if page 
* tested the website on 4k resolution with following results:
  - awaiting results...


* [HTML validator from w3c](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
* [CSS validator from w3c](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
  - both HTML and CSS validator were used to verify the website code



Most of the testing was done during development to get the desired result and were fixed in development.

## User stories testing:

1. *As a new visitor to the page, I want to be able to navigate it with ease and find what I want easily*
   - navbar is added for easy navigation which is always on top and always visible. Homepage also has links to the respective sections. Colours are consistent throughout the page for each level of knowledge so visitors know which level are they on at any given time
2. *As a new player to Cities: Skylines, I want to know if my computer can play this game*
   - minimum and recommended specifications are added to the beginners sections.
3. *As a potential player, I want to know if I can play it on my console*
   - direct links to shops where game can be bought are added; each console has it's own shop represented
4. *As a new player, I want to have relevant links when I click on one page*
   - as this was the idea behind the creation of this project, website was designed in a way to have the most searched topics and give a brief description for each relevant link in one place - this website
5. *I just bought the game, and I want to know some basic mechanics of the game*
   - beginners section was designed to give a new player a good starting ground with links to articles and video tutorials
6. *As a new visitor to this page, I want to know what is my skill level and find a relevant article/video*
   - by scrolling through the page, user can find interesting topics and immediatelly find their level of knowledge. Relevant topics are provided at a glance
7. *I have played this game a while, and I want to know which are the most essential mods so I can freely build what I want*
   - advanced section has the most used mods in a convenient table with links to each of them in workshop. Mods listed make a huge difference in the game and minimal impact on game engine. This will avoid users from conflicting mods and errors with incompatible mods ingame. A separate page is planned for future releases.
8. *As a experienced player, I want to make my cities more realistic. I want to get to the page and find articles on relevant mods and techniques*
   - a link in navbar was named just for such reason. Visitor can find the relevant links to mods and techniques in realism section
9. *I'm a city planner/Architect. I want to see if investing in this game will be easier/cheaper/faster to run simulations and present visualisations of my projects*
   - For city planners and Architects who want fast and cheap simulation of their project, there is an example of city of Stockholm. More examples are planned for future releases
10. *As a returning visitor to this page, I want to be able to learn more about the game and it's mechanics*
    - advanced section is made for such reason. Developing skills through links to articles and tutorial videos was the purpose of this section.

Left out implementations:

**Search bar:** to ease the navigation and looking for a specific term, I decided to use a navbar with integrated search bar. Tested the search function but it never worked. After consulting with mentor, decided to leave it for future releases as it's currently beyond my coding skills.


## Credits 

Cities: Skylines has a fairly large community for this type of game, which was one of the reasons why I decided to give something back, as lots of people helped me out in game and with web page. 

To use some of the content on my page, I contacted following people and they let me use their creative work:
* Michal Bergseth and his page distrita.com for which I wrote a couple of articles
* Jamie Flowers aka. MrMiyagi for use of his extensive map making tutorial
* Pug gaming for use of his on "Mods for detailing" video in realism section
* Biffa for use of his video "Basics of traffic"
* Pres for his making city more realistic video


## Content

All of the text on this page was my creation, except in the quoted sections. 
Fonts were used from Google Fonts and icons were used from Font Awesome and Icon Finder under free licence

### Media
All of the in game images were made by me while playing the game. Playlist thumbnail images were taken on the respective YouTube playlist channels, mainly publicly available Cities: Skylines Youtube page.

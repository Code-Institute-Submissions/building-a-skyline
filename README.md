# BUILDING A SKYLINE
## Project One 
Cities: Skylines - game or  a tool? Page intending to help beginners and intrigue professionals.

Idea behind this project was to make a page about game called Cities: Skylines. It is a city building simulation game. 
I already have a lot of experience with this game and a really helpfull community that is ready to help me out, I decided to make one stop page for relevant links and resources for this game. As much as my time and skill will allow it.

Most of the text and pictures will be my own, and I will reference some videos that are publicly available. I have contacted some of the friends in the community, and they allowed me to use their work as a part of my project. You can find them in *"Credits"* section.

## UX
---

As this is a page a bout a game and a tool, as you can see from the page, my targeted audience will be gamers, enthusiasts and even professionals like city planners and Architects. All of these people are connected with one mutual subject: city planing.

In this short project, I will start with introduction to the game with links to purchase and finish with mutual influence of real life and the game. Since there is a huge gap between a person who is just starting a game and a professional, the site consists of one single scrollable page divided into 6 separate sections, one of them being a navbar that will be visible at all time to ease the navigation. 

But, if you want to know more about the technical side, feel free to browse the page.

My expectation after visiting this page will be that the beginners will want to discover more about the game, and professionals will be intrigued by application of this game as a tool to help them in their simulations in real life situations. Both of these will have enough material to go on with the resources found on this page.

As for user testimonies, you can find plenty of positive reviews for this game. 
Secondly, the fact that there are very few tools that can simulate what Skylines can and that is:
* ease of use
* very accurate simulation (not perfect)
* very realistic presentation
* low cost 

As for the last one, these are the quotes from Steam game distribution service, which is currently the best platform for this purchase:

*"Through deep and rewarding gameplay, Colossal Orderâ€™s new simulation fills the increasingly noticeable void in the genre. Where others have failed, Cities: Skyline excels and delivers the new gold standard of modern city-builders."* 8.8/10 **GameInformer**

*"Best city builder I have ever played. This game is like the fairly new Sim City but with alot more put into it."* by **GSovereign**



As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
---
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used
---
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
---
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

# BUILDING A SKYLINE

Cities: Skylines - game or  a tool? Page intending to help beginners and intrigue professionals.

Idea behind this project was to make a page about game called Cities: Skylines. It is a city building simulation game. 
I already have a lot of experience with this game and a really helpfull community that is ready to help me out, I decided to make one stop page for relevant links and resources for this game. As much as my time and skill will allow it.

Most of the text and pictures will be my own, and I will reference some videos that are publicly available. I have contacted some of the friends in the community, and they allowed me to use their work as a part of my project. You can find them in *"Credits"* section.


## Demo:

## UX

As this is a page a bout a game and a tool, as you can see from the page, my targeted audience will be gamers, enthusiasts and even professionals like city planners and Architects. All of these people are connected with one mutual subject: city planing.

In this short project, I will start with introduction to the game with links to purchase and finish with mutual influence of real life and the game. Since there is a huge gap between a person who is just starting a game and a professional, the site consists of one single scrollable page divided into 6 separate sections, one of them being a navbar that will be visible at all time to ease the navigation. 

But, if you want to know more about the technical side, feel free to browse the page.

My expectation after visiting this page will be that the beginners will want to discover more about the game, and professionals will be intrigued by application of this game as a tool to help them in their simulations in real life situations. Both of these will have enough material to go on with the resources found on this page.

As for user testimonies, you can find plenty of positive reviews for this game. 
Secondly, the fact that there are very few tools that can simulate what Skylines can and that is:
* ease of use
* very accurate simulation (not perfect)
* very realistic presentation
* low cost 

As for the last one, these are the quotes from Steam game distribution service, which is currently the best platform for this purchase:

>*"Through deep and rewarding gameplay, Colossal Orderâ€™s new simulation fills the increasingly noticeable void in the genre. Where others have failed, Cities: Skyline excels and delivers the new gold standard of modern city-builders."* 8.8/10 **GameInformer**

>*"Best city builder I have ever played. This game is like the fairly new Sim City but with alot more put into it."* by **GSovereign**

All the preparations for this page were used from different sources: 
* I used classic "_pen and paper_" method to give the page it's rough outline,
* tested some of the designs with Balsamiq
* made a poll in Skylines group on Facebook to see what people are most interested in. Unfortunatelly, group is private and I can't leave a link to it.
* browsed different pages like Facebook, Reddit, Discord groups to see targeted audience biggest interests
* browsed official Cities: Skylines page and Youtube channel for most appropriate info which is supported by game developer


There was also an idea to have a section dedicated to traffic in this game, as people expressed most interest in this. Unfortunatelly, this will require another section on this page for which I won't have enough time, so I left this for future releases.

## Features

Simplicity was the basic idea behind this project and that was proven to be difficult, as this game has a lot of content, large community and is limited by peoples imagination.
 That's why I have 4 sections:
 * Intro page
 * Beginners section
 * Advanced section and
 * Pro section
  
### Existing Features

Each section is dedicated to users with different level of knowledge while the pro section might be usefull to even professionals such as city planners. Accordingly to these sections, each interest group has links that they can benefit from:

**Intro section** is designed as simple as possible: pick your level of knowledge and follow the links. Also, during the development of this page, I found very usefull navbar with search function integrated into it. If people are looking for specific thing, that's where they can reffer to, right at the intro page.REason why this navbar is a the bottom instead of on top is that the toolbar in game is at the bottom of the UI in game. As it has the same colour, old players will be used to it and new ones will get introduced to it.

**Beginners** section was created for users who want to buy the game and ones who just did that, but don't know where to go next. In this part, they will be able to see if they can play the game on their console or is their computer strong enough to run the game. Also, there are links to very basics like terminology in the game and some video tutorials.

**Advanced** section is for the people who have some experience with the game and want to know how to make their ideas into reality. Therefore, there are links to basic map making, and traffic, links to workshop so users can expand the abilities of the game with most used mods which is most often asked question in any group and/or forum.

**Pro** section is for people who know how to handle all of the game's tools including mods, but want to make their cities look more realistic. That's why I added some mods that are used late in the game. This will enable users to have more detailed cities with better looking visuals, and a comprehensive guide to map making. This is also where I added links to content creators for the game, added videos and playlists which will relate this game to the real world and it's application. Maybe even intrigues some visitors to start making mods and assets for the game.

### Features Left to Implement

After this project is submitted, there are plans to re-use it to make a portal after I gain enough knowledge in web programming(and have time) to do it. Basically, this project will be a base on which I will continue adding content, untill all or most of the content is my own. But, as I said, if my time will allow me.

As mentioned before, people expressed most interest in traffic in this game. However, due to lack of time, I decided to leave this for future releases as it has a lot of ground to cover and cannot be explained in just a couple of links.

## Technologies Used

Tools used building this page consist of:

**HTML** - Used for creating the content and building the basic framework for the page

**CSS** - used for formating, beautifying the page and also for some effects

**JavaScript** - used within bootstrap to create colapsable navbar for smaller screens

**[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** - used this library to simplify, speed up and optimise the page creation and looks of the page

**[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)** and **[Icon Finder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)** - for custom icons

**[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)** - knowledge(or lack of) base on how to make certain element

**[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)** - to figure out why something isn't working

**[Github](https://github.com/)** and **[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)** - to build and host the page

**[Repl.it](https://repl.it/)** - to re-use the code I practiced with

**[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)** - to backup the page locally


## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
---
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
